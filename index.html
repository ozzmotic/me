    Hi, I'm Alex (she/her/hers). I'm a socially-conscious user experience researcher trained in human-centered design. Proven experience in bringing ideas from initial conception to implementation and dissemination. Sensitive and thoughtful in the application of qualitative methods, including interviews, user testing, and surveys. Refined aesthetic eye for static and interactive layouts, with experience in Adobe inDesign and XD. Software development experience in Android, NativeScript, and Vue.js, and data analysis and visualization experience in Tableau, R, MATLAB, and d3.js. Extensive experience working on open source software teams, and on collaborative and individual projects leading to multiple peer-reviewed research publications.
